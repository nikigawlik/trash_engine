# TRASH ENGINE

Trash Engine is a small and trashy, quick and dirty game engine for making 2D games in the browser.

This repository contains the code for trash engine! It uses Svelte as a web framework and Vite as a a dev server.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode).

Basic knowledge of node js is assumed.

Use `npm install` to install dependencies, `npm run dev` for a dev server, `npm run build` to build the engine (produces a single html file) and `npm run preview` to run the build locally.

## trash

In the spirit of the engine there are no unit tests and insufficient documentation (jk I'll get around to these things it I promise!!)
