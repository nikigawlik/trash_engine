## Disclaimer

This engine is in alpha. It comes without any warranty, contains bugs, and is generally rough around the edges.

This version of the engine is v.0.0.1, and was published Dec 15, 2022.

Feel free to send bugs and feedback to me on [Itch](https://nikigawlik.itch.io/) or [Mastodon](https://peoplemaking.games/@niki).

Some things to consider using this engine:

 - you can save&load different versions of this game using the save and load buttons
 - (these are stored in your browser, specifically your indexed db storage)
 - you can return to the original game, by deleting all save data in the settings menu
 - alternatively you can create a save right now, to have a copy of the original state!
 - you can (and should) keep backups of the data using the export button
 - be careful with big images! The engine was tested on sprites in the 60-120 pixel range, very high-res images might break the engine.

Have fun! :)
